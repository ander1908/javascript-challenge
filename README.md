# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

We were tasked with setting up a html page,then tasked with importing and analyzing data from the given data.js. We were then to create a table including:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

Able to be searched using filters, initial input was only for datetime, by using an or statement we created the ability to search with other values
